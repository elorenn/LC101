  console.log(`\nError, Cannot Compute: ${howMany} is longer than the word "${str}."\n\nHowever, if you move the first 3 characters of "${str}" to the end, it looks like "${newString}."`);
}

//Use a template literal to print the original and modified string in a descriptive phrase.


//b) Modify your code to accept user input. Query the user to enter the number of letters that will be relocated.


//c) Add validation to your code to deal with user inputs that are longer than the word. In such cases, default to moving 3 characters. Also, the template literal should note the error.
