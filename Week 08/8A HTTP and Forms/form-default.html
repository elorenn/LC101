<!-- When a form is submitted a key-value pair is created for each named input. The keys are the values of the name attributes, and they are paired with the content of the value attributes. 
  
The web address is the same as the form we loaded, but now includes a query parameter for every input, with a name, in the form. These parameters are known as the query string parameters.

The form values are submitted via the query string because the default submission type for forms is GET. In the next section, we will soon learn how to submit form data via POST. 

Data submitted by GET requests is less secure than POST because GET request URLs and the query parameters are cached and logged, possibly leaking sensitive data.-->
